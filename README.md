## 📱 Overview

**Amar Proshno** is a simple yet polished multiple-choice quiz application built with Flutter. The project focuses on clean UI design, smooth user experience, and straightforward application architecture while keeping the implementation lightweight and easy to understand.

All questions and answers are stored locally using hardcoded data, with no backend or external APIs.

---

## 🎨 Design Theme

The app follows a consistent **soft purple / lavender gradient** design language across all screens:

- **Background** — Full-screen vertical gradient: `#E1D5F5 → #CFBEF0 → #BFA8E8`
- **Primary color** — Deep purple `#5E35B1` / `#7E57C2` / `#9575CD`
- **Cards** — Organic blob-shaped containers with asymmetric rounded corners and semi-transparent purple fills
- **Buttons** — Pill-shaped (`borderRadius: 30`) with filled and outlined variants
- **Option tiles** — Pill-shaped rows with circular letter badge (A, B, C, D) on the left
- **Typography** — Wide letter-spacing uppercase labels, deep purple text `#4A148C`
